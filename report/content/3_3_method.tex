\chapter{Method}
In this chapter the work environment and the procedure is explained. 

\section{Frameworks and tools}
This work uses Python $3.8.10$ as programming language for the data analysis as well as for the training and evaluation of the models. Python already offers many high-end libraries for \gls{ml}. Jupyter notebooks were used to write and adjust all code. Important snippets were moved into python files to reuse it in multiple notebooks.
