\chapter*{Abstract}

% Transfer learning has become common practice in the field of image recognition. Ideally, models exist that have been trained on images from the same domain. Medical data and pre-trained models are very sparse and often not publicly available. General models such as ImageNet offer an alternative when there is a shortage of medical data. For skin diseases, the structure of the images differs significantly from the general images from ImageNet. Therefore, the question arises whether images from a similar domain such as plant diseases are a better alternative to general models.

% The usage of artificial intelligence gained influence in the field of dermatology during the past years. However, large data sets for image recognition are sparse and often not freely available. It is now state of the art to use pre-trained weights for neural networks in order to shorten training or improve performance. Typically, general weights such as those from ImageNet are used.
