To develop technique, Freedman also includes computer labs, with sample computer programs, and illustrates the principles and pitfalls of modeling. The book is rich in exercises with answers. Target audiences include undergraduates and beginning graduate students in statistics, as well as students and professionals in the social and health sciences.}},
