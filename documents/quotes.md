"At present, most of the current deep learning-based methods for plant diseases and pests detection are applied on specific datasets, many datasets are not publicly available, there is still no single publicly available and comprehensive dataset that will allow all algorithms to be uniformly compared. " https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903739/

"It is clear from the results shown in Figs. 7 to 9 that the proposed PDDD-based and PlantVillage-based plant disease pre-training models outperform the generic ImageNet-based pre-training models in terms of both training efficiency and accuracy. This suggests that the plant disease domain is specialized and has specific knowledge that is different from the generic domain. Thus, pre-training using plant disease datasets can provide more prior knowledge that is beneficial for plant disease diagnosis." https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/plantphenomics.0054
