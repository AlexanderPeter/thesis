self-supervised learning (SSL)

- MAE + CBAM

datasets

- CCMT dataset (field photos)
- PLD dataset

ResNet50, ViT, and MAE

mixing self-supervised and supervised methods can improve the performance of the system if there is a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data

MAE: reconstruct masked parts
